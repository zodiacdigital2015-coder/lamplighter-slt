# LampLighter SLT: Institutional Memory Agent

**Version 1.0.1**

LampLighter SLT is a specialized strategic analysis tool designed for Senior Leadership Teams in UK Further Education. 

It acts as a secure "Institutional Memory" interface, allowing leaders to interrogate their college's document corpus—Strategic Plans, Board Minutes, SARs, and QIPs—to identify recurring risks, track historical commitments, and ensure strategic alignment.

## Key Capabilities

* **Strategic Lenses:** Analyse queries through specific frameworks, including Risk Patterns, Historical Context, and Strategic Alignment.
* **Stakeholder Perspectives:** Filter analysis through specific viewpoints (e.g., Financial Sustainability, Quality of Education, Reputational Risk).
* **Adaptive Personas:** The agent adopts calibrated voices to suit the audience, including *The Principal* (Visionary), *The Finance Director* (Prudent/Risk-Averse), and *The VP Quality* (Evidence-Based).
* **Forensic Grounding:** Prioritises "Approved Records" to exclude drafts and grounds all assertions in cited internal evidence.

## Security & Privacy

LampLighter SLT is built with a "Privacy First" architecture suitable for executive data:
* **Stateless Operation:** No sensitive data is stored in the application layer.
* **Confidentiality Lock:** An optional "Strict Redaction Mode" strips names, student IDs, and salary figures from AI outputs.
* **External Context Mode:** Securely cross-references external white papers against internal strategy without training the model on the external data.

## Technology Stack

This is a lightweight **Node.js / Express** application designed for stateless deployment (e.g., Render.com). It serves as a secure frontend orchestration layer for a custom **Microsoft Copilot Studio** agent.

## License

LampLighter SLT is released under the terms of the **MIT License**.
